## ❓ 〢 About
⚙️ Cyborg is an obscure closed-source ransomware builder created by Cyber SpLiTTer.    
It encrypts every file with AES-PBKDF2 and comes with some malicious toggleable features.    
  
🧰 The binaries code has been decompiled and fixed to its original state, making it moddable.    
Because of that, you no longer need to pay the author to get any kind of source/build.  

🛠️ Work in progress, the source will be published in few days, working on stub deobfuscation.
